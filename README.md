# system-data-CPU-Memory


The codespace consists of an application that gives a visual representation of the CPU and memory usage of PC. The backend is designed using Python in a Flask framework and the frontend is designed using JavaScript and HTML and deployed in local using node.js

Executing the Jenkins pipeline would run the backend in localhost:5000 and frontend in localhost:5050

A webhook has been added so that any changes pushed to the repository will trigger the pipeline in Jenkins
